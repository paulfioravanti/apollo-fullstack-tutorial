# Apollo Tutorial

This is my sandbox for the fullstack app for the [Apollo tutorial][].

Currently, I haven't done anything special with the front end, but I have
attempted to refactor and introduce [Typescript][] to the back end application.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:paulfioravanti/apollo-fullstack-tutorial.git
cd apollo-fullstack-tutorial
```

Run each application in a separate terminal window:

## Back End

```sh
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> to get a GraphQL Playground interface.

## Front End

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> to open the application.
